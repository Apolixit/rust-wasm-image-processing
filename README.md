# Rust WebAssembly image processing with Vue JS

A simple Rust and VueJS project to train with webassembly.
It's a POC application to allow some image processing (based on https://crates.io/crates/image crate).
It can perform some basic filter (huerotate / brightness etc) and some custom filters.

To start the project follow these steps :
```
cd www
npm install
npm run wasm
npm run dev
```
